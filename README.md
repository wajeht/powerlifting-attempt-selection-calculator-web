This website is designed to take your heaviest lift within 1-2 weeks before the competition, and calculate attempt selection based on that. Nothing more, nothing less!

# Motivation

I built this website intending to share the strategies for selecting attempts for powerlifters. For those of you who could not afford for coaching and some of the athletes that I coach for powerlifting.

# How to use?

Enter the heaviest weight lifted within past 1-2 weeks. I would recommand the heaviest single you hit a week out before meet. If you hit and half rpe, for example. squat: x1@8.5, I would recommand you to put x1@9 instead. It is better to move up a half rpe for accuracy. If you do not know whether your singles, are you can enter the heaviest weight lifted with certain reps.

The less reps close to singles, are the better for accurate prediction. After that, you can autoregulate attempts based on how you feel on meet day. I laied out low, normal, and high. It is pretty self explainatory.
